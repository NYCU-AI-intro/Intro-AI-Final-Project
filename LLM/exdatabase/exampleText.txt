Name
A Survey of Route Recommendations: Methods, Applications, and Opportunities

Abstract
Nowadays, with advanced information technologies deployed citywide, large data volumes and powerful computa-
tional resources are intelligentizing modern city development. As an important part of intelligent transportation, route
recommendation and its applications are widely used, directly influencing citizensâ€™ travel habits. Developing smart
and efficient travel routes based on big data (possibly multi-modal) has become a central challenge in route recommen-
dation research. Our survey offers a comprehensive review of route recommendation work based on urban computing.
It is organized by the following three parts: 1) Methodology-wise. We categorize a large volume of classic methods
and modern deep learning methods. Also, we discuss their historical relations and reveal the edge-cutting progress.
2) Application-wise. We present numerous novel applications related to route commendation within urban computing
scenarios. 3) We discuss current problems and challenges and envision several promising research directions. We
believe that this survey can help relevant researchers quickly familiarize themselves with the current state of route
recommendation research and then direct them to future research trends.
